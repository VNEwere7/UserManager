# User Manager

This repository contains a simple demo API built with NodeJS.
The API is used to manage users in a MongoDB database.
The application has been "dockerized", so you can start it up with little or no knowledge of the underlying technology.


### Development
This application was developed using [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/). MongoDB was used for persisting data with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) as [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping). [Docker](https://www.docker.com) was used to pack and ship all the required libraries and dependencies as one package for easier installation and use of the application.

### Setting Docker up
* Start up your terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows OS).
* Ensure that you have `docker` installed on your computer.
* Clone the repository by entering the command `git clone https://github.com/VNEwere7/UserManager` in the terminal.
* Navigate to the project folder using `cd UserManager/Docker` on your terminal (or command prompt)
* After cloning, start docker with the command `service docker start`.
* After this, you can then start the app with the command: `./setup.sh`.

### Testing
To ensure that your installation is successful you'll need to run tests.
The command: `npm test` makes this possible. It isn't functional right now, but once it's done you'll be notified via the README.

### API Documentation
The API only has one endpoint which is the `/users` endpoint for saving users to the database. The endpoint works with the HTTP verbs: `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`.
